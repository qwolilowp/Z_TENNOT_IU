# Prototype
I experimented with muisc interaction. I worked on a coding composition environment and a 
gesture based performance tool. Two examples:

Now I want to continue on this topic with a little prototype of a multitouch input / sequencer (z_tennot_iu working title). 
Maybe someone want to build it, so I added this little documentation.


## Hardware
The build is a light wooden enclosure housing a 24" touchscreen and a minicomputer. Its style is close to module synth enclosures.

### Parts list
- Raspberry 4
- powersupply (? usb-c cable)
- Iiyama ProLite T2454MSC 24"
- a sheet of plywood
- USB- and MINIHDMI-cable
- xxGB microSDHC card
- wool glue and screws

### Process
T
### Notes
W

## Software

I prepared a Rasbian installation and configured it to run on the hardware as intended.
