# Prototype
I experimented with muisc interaction. I worked on a coding composition environment and a 
gesture based performance tool. 

PICS

Now I want to continue on this topic with a little prototype of a multitouch input / sequencer (z_tennot_iu working title). 
Maybe someone want to build it, so I added this little documentation.


## Hardware
The build is a light wooden enclosure housing a 24" touchscreen and a minicomputer. Its style is close to module synth enclosures.

### Parts list
- Raspberry 4

### Process
T
### Notes
W

## Software

I prepared a Rasbian installation and configured it to run on the hardware as intended.
